# muonFlux

Quick and dirty study on muon fluxes at sea-level.  Currently, this uses measurements from the [BESS-TEV experiment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0403704.pdf).  The data is used to compute the total rate expected per unit area per unit solid angle and the rate per unit area per unit solid angle per unit energy.
